# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Multimodal Data

This project aims to detect Parkinson's disease at an early stage using multimodal data, including voice, speech, and gait measurements.

## Dataset
- **Parkinson's Telemonitoring Dataset**: Voice measurements.
- **Parkinson's Disease Dataset (UCI)**: Voice measurements + labels.
- **Parkinson's Speech Dataset**: Multiple types of sound recordings.
- **Gait in Parkinson's Disease Dataset**: Gait sensor data.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw datasets.
- `src/`: Contains scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project description.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
